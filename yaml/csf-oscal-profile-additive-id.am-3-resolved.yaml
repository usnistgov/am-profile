          prose: Data flow diagrams enable a manufacturer to understand the flow of data between networked
            components. Documenting data flows enables organizations to understand expected behavior of
            their networks. This understanding of how devices communicate assists with troubleshooting
            as well as response and recovery activities. This information can be leveraged during forensic
            activities or used for analysis to identify anomalies.

          prose: Data flow diagrams for AM processes represent not only the flow of data between networked
            components, but also relationships between data elements and their impacts on printed parts.
            AM provides more freedom in design complexity than other manufacturing technologies. Therefore,
            AM processes are heavily data-driven. Examples of AM data elements that can be manipulated
            to adversely affect the manufacturing process include CAD geometry data, material specifications,
            AM machine function specifications, and process parameters such as layer thickness and infill
            pattern. Examples of adverse impacts include porosity, tensile strength, anisotropy, surface
            roughness, and geometric and dimensional inaccuracy.
