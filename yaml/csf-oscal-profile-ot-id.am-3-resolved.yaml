          business purposes are identified and managed consistent with their relative importance to organizational
          objectives and the organizationâ€™s risk strategy.

          prose: Data flow diagrams enable a manufacturer to understand the flow of data between networked
            components. Documenting data flows enables organizations to understand expected behavior of
            their networks. This understanding of how devices communicate assists with troubleshooting
            as well as response and recovery activities. This information can be leveraged during forensic
            activities or used for analysis to identify anomalies.

          prose: Organizations should consider the impact on OT systems from the use of automated data
            flow mapping tools that use active scanning or require network monitoring tools (e.g., in-line
            network probes). Impacts could be due to the nature of the information, the volume of network
            traffic, or momentary disconnection of manufacturing system components from the network. Consider
            using data flow mapping tools that utilize these methods during planned downtime.
